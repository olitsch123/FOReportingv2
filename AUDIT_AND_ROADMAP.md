   - Missing validations → Comprehensive test suite
   - Time-series gaps → Interpolation algorithms

3. **Operational Risks**
   - User adoption → Phased rollout with training

2. **This Week**: Implement multi-method extraction framework
3. **Next Week**: Build validation engine
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test document set

## Investment Required

- **Development**: 6-8 weeks of focused effort
- **Testing**: 2 weeks of thorough validation
- **Training**: 1 week of user onboarding
- **Total Timeline**: 8-10 weeks to production

## Conclusion

The FOReporting v2 project has a solid foundation but requires significant PE-specific development to meet production requirements. The most critical gap is the unapplied database schema, which blocks all other PE functionality. With focused execution on the roadmap above, the system can achieve competitive parity with industry leaders like Canoe and Cobalt LP within 8-10 weeks.

The key to success will be:
1. Immediate database schema implementation
2. Rigorous extraction accuracy testing
3. Comprehensive validation framework
4. Automated reconciliation capabilities

With these components in place, FOReporting v2 will provide institutional-grade PE fund reporting and analytics.
