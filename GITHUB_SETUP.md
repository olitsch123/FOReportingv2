# GitHub Setup Guide for FOReporting v2

## 🚀 Quick Setup

Your local Git repository is ready! Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button → **"New repository"**
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `FOReportingv2`
   - **Description**: `Financial Document Intelligence System - Automated PE/VC fund reporting with AI-powered document processing`
   - **Visibility**: Private (recommended for financial data)
   - **Don't check** "Initialize this repository with README" (we already have one)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FOReportingv2.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username!

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, you should see all your files on GitHub:
- ✅ README.md with project description
- ✅ Complete source code in `app/` directory
- ✅ Deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- ✅ Requirements and configuration files

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Important: Protect Your API Keys!

The repository includes a `.gitignore` file that prevents your `.env` file from being uploaded. This protects your:
- OpenAI API key
- Database credentials
- Private folder paths

**Never commit your `.env` file to version control!**

### Repository Visibility

Consider making the repository **Private** because it contains:
- Financial data processing logic
- Investment-related code
- Potentially sensitive business logic
