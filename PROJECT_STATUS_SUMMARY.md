# FOReporting v2 - Project Status Summary

## Overall Completion: 30%

### Component Status

| Component | Status | Completion | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Infrastructure** | ✅ Working | 90% | Low | Docker, API, Database setup complete |
| **Basic Processing** | ⚠️ Partial | 70% | Low | PDF/Excel/CSV processing works |
| **Frontend Dashboard** | ⚠️ Partial | 60% | Low | Basic UI functional |
| **PE Database Schema** | ❌ Not Applied | 0% | **CRITICAL** | Migration exists but not run - **BLOCKER** |
| **Advanced Extraction** | ❌ Missing | 10% | High | No multi-method extraction |
| **Validation Engine** | ❌ Missing | 0% | High | No balance/continuity checks |
| **Reconciliation** | ❌ Missing | 0% | Medium | No automated reconciliation |
| **PE API Endpoints** | ⚠️ Minimal | 20% | Medium | Basic endpoints only |

### Critical Path Analysis

```
1. PE Schema Migration (0%) ──┐
                              ├─► Advanced Extraction (10%) ──► Validation (0%) ──► Reconciliation (0%)
2. Field Library Seed (0%) ───┘
```

### Time to Completion

| Scenario | Timeline | Effort | Risk |
|----------|----------|--------|------|
| **Aggressive** | 6 weeks | Full-time dedicated team | High |
| **Realistic** | 8-10 weeks | Dedicated developer | Medium |
| **Conservative** | 12 weeks | Part-time effort | Low |

### Immediate Blockers

1. **PE Schema Not Applied** - Nothing PE-specific can work until this is fixed
2. **No Extraction Framework** - Cannot extract capital account data accurately
3. **No Validation Rules** - Cannot ensure data quality

### Quick Wins Available

1. **Apply PE Schema** (1 hour) - Unlocks everything
2. **Basic Extraction** (2 days) - Immediate value
3. **Simple Validation** (1 day) - Catch obvious errors
4. **Manual Override UI** (1 day) - User confidence

### Resource Requirements

| Phase | Developer Days | Skills Required |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Database Schema | 2-3 | SQL, Alembic |
| Extraction Engine | 5-7 | Python, Regex, AI |
| Validation Framework | 5-7 | Python, Finance |
| Reconciliation | 3-5 | Python, Async |
| API Enhancement | 3-5 | FastAPI, SQL |
| Frontend Updates | 3-5 | Streamlit, React |
| Testing | 5-7 | Pytest, Domain |
| **Total** | **26-39 days** | **Full-stack + Finance** |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Schema migration fails | Critical | Low | Test in staging first |
| Extraction accuracy <95% | High | Medium | Multi-method approach |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Implement caching |
| User adoption | Medium | Medium | Training + phased rollout |

### Go/No-Go Decision Factors

**GO** ✅
- Solid foundation exists
- Clear roadmap defined
- Achievable in 8-10 weeks
- High business value

**Challenges** ⚠️
- Significant work remaining (70%)
- Complex PE domain knowledge required
- Testing needs real documents
- Production readiness standards high

### Recommendation

**Proceed with Phase 1 immediately** - The PE schema migration is a simple task that unlocks everything else. Without it, the system cannot handle PE-specific data. This is a 1-hour task with massive impact.

After schema migration:
1. Focus on capital account extraction (highest value)
2. Build basic validation (ensure quality)
3. Create simple reconciliation (build trust)
4. Enhance incrementally

The project is very achievable but requires focused execution over the next 8-10 weeks.
