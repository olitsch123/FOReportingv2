# Immediate Action Plan - FOReporting v2

## 🚨 Critical Blockers to Address First

### 1. Apply PE Enhanced Schema Migration (Day 1)
```bash
# First, ensure database is accessible
python scripts/health_check.py

# Apply the PE enhanced schema
alembic upgrade pe_enhanced_001

# Verify migration success
python -c "from app.database.connection import init_database; engine, _ = init_database(); print('Tables:', engine.table_names())"
```

### 2. Fix Database Connection Issues (Day 1)
The system appears to be running without database connectivity. Need to:
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check .env configuration [[memory:8017954]]
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct for your deployment mode

### 3. Implement Basic Capital Account Extractor (Day 2-3)
Create `app/pe_docs/extractors/capital_account.py`:
```python
class CapitalAccountExtractor:
    def extract(self, text, tables):
        # Implement multi-method extraction
        # Start with regex patterns from classifiers.py
        # Add table extraction logic
        # Return structured data with confidence
```

## 🔧 Quick Wins for Immediate Impact

1. **Enable PE Schema Tables**
   - Unlocks all PE-specific functionality
   - Required for any meaningful PE features

2. **Add Extraction Confidence Scores**
   - Simple to implement
   - Provides immediate value
   - Helps identify problem documents

3. **Create Manual Override Interface**
   - Allows users to correct extractions
   - Builds user confidence
   - Provides training data

4. **Implement Basic Reconciliation**
   - Start with simple balance checks
   - Flag obvious errors
   - Build foundation for complex rules

## 📊 Success Metrics for Week 1

- [ ] PE schema migration applied successfully
- [ ] Extract 5 key fields from capital account statements
- [ ] 90%+ accuracy on test documents
- [ ] API response time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Zero database connection errors

## 🚀 Getting Started Commands

```bash
# 1. Check system health
python check_system.py

# 2. Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 3. Seed test data
python scripts/seed_field_library.py

# 4. Run API server
python -m app.main

# 5. Test extraction
python scripts/test_processing.py

# 6. Launch dashboard
streamlit run app/frontend/dashboard.py
```

## 📝 Notes for Development

1. **Use existing code** - The classifiers.py already has regex patterns
2. **Start simple** - Get basic extraction working before optimization
3. **Test often** - Use real PE documents for testing
4. **Log everything** - Audit trail is critical for PE
5. **Ask for help** - Complex extractions may need domain expertise

## 🎯 Definition of "Week 1 Success"

By end of Week 1, you should be able to:
1. View PE-specific tables in the database
2. Extract capital account data with confidence scores
3. Validate basic mathematical relationships
4. Query time-series data via API
5. See extraction results in the dashboard

Focus on getting the foundation right - everything else builds on top!
