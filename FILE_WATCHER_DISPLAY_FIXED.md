# File Watcher Display Fixed ‚úÖ

## The Problem
The file watcher was showing as "‚ùå File_Watcher: stopped" in the frontend sidebar, which was misleading because a stopped file watcher isn't an error - it's just not running.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Icon Logic in Dashboard
Changed the display logic to show appropriate icons for each state:
- **‚úÖ File_Watcher: running** - When actively monitoring folders
- **‚è∏Ô∏è File_Watcher: stopped** - When paused/stopped (not an error!)
- **‚ùå File_Watcher: error** - Only for actual errors

### 2. Fixed Missing Import
Added missing `Path` import in `app/main.py` that was causing errors in the file watcher status endpoint.

## Result

### Before:
```
‚ùå File_Watcher: stopped  (Looks like an error!)
```

### After:
```
‚è∏Ô∏è File_Watcher: stopped  (Clearly shows it's just paused)
```

## How to Verify

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:8501
2. Look at the sidebar under "System Status"
3. You should now see:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è File_Watcher: stopped (when not running)
   - ‚úÖ File_Watcher: running (when active)

## File Watcher States Explained

- **stopped** (‚è∏Ô∏è) - Service is available but not actively monitoring
- **running** (‚úÖ) - Actively monitoring configured folders for new files
- **error** (‚ùå) - Only shown if there's an actual problem

The file watcher is now properly integrated and displays its state correctly! üéâ
