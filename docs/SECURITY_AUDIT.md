# Security Audit Report - FOReporting v2

## Executive Summary

✅ **Overall Security Status: GOOD**

FOReporting v2 has been audited for security vulnerabilities and hardened with comprehensive security measures. The system follows security best practices for financial document processing.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 🛡️ **Input Validation & Sanitization**

**✅ File Path Security:**
- Path traversal protection (blocks `../`, `~` patterns)
- Whitelist validation against allowed base directories
- File extension validation (PDF, Excel, CSV only)
- File size limits (100MB max)
- Existence and readability checks

**✅ Input Sanitization:**
- Investor code format validation (alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen only)
- UUID validation for fund IDs
- Text input sanitization (removes script tags, JavaScript)
- SQL injection prevention (SQLAlchemy ORM used throughout)

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**

**✅ API Security:**
- API key authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Bearer token support
- Rate limiting (60 requests/minute, 10 burst limit)
- IP blocking for abuse (5-minute blocks)
- Failed authentication attempt logging

**✅ Access Control:**
- Role-based access (API key required for processing)
- Endpoint-specific rate limits (processing: 10/min, chat: 30/min)
- Development mode bypass for local testing

### 🌐 **Network Security**

**✅ HTTP Security Headers:**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (prevents clickjacking)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (prevents MIME sniffing)
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` (XSS protection)
- `Content-Security-Policy` (restricts resource loading)
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS enforcement in production)

**✅ CORS Configuration:**
- Production: Restricted to specific origins
- Development: Configurable via environment
- Credentials support with proper origin validation

### 🗄️ **Data Security**

**✅ Database Security:**
- Environment-based connection strings (no hardcoded credentials)
- Connection pooling with limits
- Query timeouts to prevent DoS
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- UUID primary keys (prevents enumeration attacks)

**✅ Secrets Management:**
- All secrets in environment variables
- No hardcoded API keys or passwords
- Separate configuration for different environments
- API key format validation

### 📝 **Logging & Monitoring**

**✅ Security Logging:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Input validation failures
- File access attempts
- Error details with request correlation IDs

**✅ Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Prometheus metrics for security events
- Grafana dashboards for security monitoring
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity
- Real-time threat detection

### ⚠️ **Recommendations for Production**

1. **SSL/TLS Configuration**
   - Use HTTPS in production (handled by reverse proxy/load balancer)
   - Configure proper SSL certificates
   - Enable HSTS headers

2. **Database Security**
   - Enable SSL for database connections in production
   - Use connection pooling with authentication
   - Regular security updates for PostgreSQL

3. **Container Security**
   - Run containers as non-root user (already implemented)
   - Regular base image updates
   - Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

4. **API Key Management**
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Use different keys for different environments
   - Monitor API key usage patterns

5. **File Upload Security**
   - Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
   - Quarantine suspicious files
   - Content type validation beyond file extensions

## Security Testing

### ✅ **Automated Security Checks**

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Bandit security scanner in GitHub Actions
- Safety vulnerability scanner for dependencies
- Trivy container security scanning
- Pre-commit hooks for security validation

**Regular Scanning:**
```bash
# Run security scans
bandit -r app/ -f json
safety check --json
```

### 🧪 **Security Test Cases**

**Input Validation Tests:**
- Path traversal attempts (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- File extension bypass attempts
- Large file uploads (DoS testing)
- Malicious investor codes

**Authentication Tests:**
- Missing API key attempts
- Invalid API key formats
- Rate limit testing
- Concurrent request flooding

## Compliance Considerations

### 📋 **Financial Data Protection**

**Data Classification:**
- Financial documents: Confidential
- Performance metrics: Restricted
- Investor information: Personal data

**Access Controls:**
- API key authentication required
- Audit logging for all data access
- Request correlation for investigation

**Data Retention:**
- Configurable retention periods
- Secure deletion procedures
- Backup encryption

### 🌍 **Privacy Compliance**

**GDPR Considerations:**
- Data minimization (only necessary data stored)
- Right to erasure (deletion capabilities)
- Data portability (export functions)
- Privacy by design principles

## Incident Response

### 🚨 **Security Monitoring**

**Real-time Alerts:**
- Failed authentication attempts > 10/minute
- Rate limit violations
