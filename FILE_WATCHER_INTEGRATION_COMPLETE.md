# File Watcher Integration Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

### 1. API Endpoints Added
- **POST /file-watcher/start** - Start the file watcher service
- **POST /file-watcher/stop** - Stop the file watcher service  
- **GET /file-watcher/status** - Get current status and details

### 2. Health Endpoint Updated
- Changed from hardcoded "manual" to actual status ("running" or "stopped")
- Now reflects real file watcher state

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### Sidebar Controls
- Live status indicator (‚úÖ Running / ‚è∏Ô∏è Stopped)
- Shows number of watched folders
- Shows queue size if files are pending
- Start/Stop buttons with proper state management
- Expandable list of watched folders

#### Dashboard Section
- New "File Watcher Activity" section on main dashboard
- Shows active/inactive status
- Displays metrics for watched folders and queue
- Expandable folder list

## How It Works

1. **Backend Service**: The file watcher runs as a background service that monitors configured folders
2. **API Control**: Start/stop the service via REST API endpoints
3. **Real-time Status**: Health and stats endpoints report actual service state
4. **Frontend Controls**: Interactive buttons in sidebar to control the service
5. **Activity Monitoring**: Dashboard shows current activity and queued files

## Testing Results

‚úÖ API endpoints working correctly
‚úÖ Start/stop functionality verified
‚úÖ Status reporting accurate
‚úÖ Frontend controls integrated
‚úÖ Health endpoint shows proper status

## Usage

### Via Frontend (Recommended)
1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Look at the sidebar under "File Watcher"
3. Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start to begin monitoring
4. Click ‚èπÔ∏è Stop to pause monitoring
5. Check main dashboard for activity details

### Via API
```bash
# Start file watcher
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/file-watcher/start

# Stop file watcher  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/file-watcher/stop

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8000/file-watcher/status
```

## Benefits

- **No more "manual" status** - Shows real service state
- **Full control** - Start/stop as needed
- **Visibility** - See what folders are being watched
- **Queue monitoring** - Know if files are pending processing
- **Integrated UI** - Control everything from the dashboard

The file watcher is now fully integrated with the frontend and can be controlled directly from the UI! üéâ
