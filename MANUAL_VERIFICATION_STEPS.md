# Manual Verification Steps - Please Run These Commands

Since the terminal output isn't displaying, please run these commands manually to verify the actual state of the project:

## 1. Check Docker Status
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
docker ps
```

Expected: Should show Docker version and list of running containers.

## 2. Start Docker Containers
```bash
cd C:\Users\OliverGÃ¶tz\Desktop\FOReportingv2
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
```

Expected: Should show postgres and backend containers running.

## 3. Check API Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Or in PowerShell:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

Expected: Should return health status JSON.

## 4. Test Database Connection
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U system -d foreporting_db -c "\dt"
```

Expected: Should list all PE tables.

## 5. Test PE Module Imports
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python -c "from app.pe_docs.extractors.multi_method import MultiMethodExtractor; print('Import successful')"
```

Expected: Should print "Import successful".

## 6. Check for Import Errors
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python -c "import app.pe_docs.extractors; import app.pe_docs.reconciliation; print('All imports OK')"
```

Expected: Should print "All imports OK" or show specific import errors.

## 7. Run PE Test Script
```bash
docker cp test_pe_functionality.py foreportingv2-backend-1:/app/
docker-compose exec backend python /app/test_pe_functionality.py
```

Expected: Should show extraction test results.

## 8. Check Logs for Errors
```bash
docker-compose logs backend | tail -50
docker-compose logs postgres | tail -50
```

Expected: Should show recent log entries, look for errors.

## 9. Test PE API Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/pe/health
```

Expected: Should return PE module health status.

## 10. Check File Permissions
```bash
dir data\investor1
dir data\investor2
```

Expected: Directories should exist and be writable.

## Please Report Back:

After running these commands, please let me know:

1. **Which commands worked?**
2. **Which failed and with what errors?**
3. **Are Docker containers running?**
4. **Can you reach the API?**
5. **Do the PE modules import without errors?**

Based on your findings, I can provide specific fixes for the actual issues rather than assuming everything is working.

## If Everything Fails:

Try this minimal test outside Docker:
```bash
# In project root
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "from app.pe_docs.extractors.base import BaseExtractor; print('Basic import works')"
```

This will tell us if the code structure itself is valid.
